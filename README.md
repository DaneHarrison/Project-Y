# Development roadmap
## Phase 1:
1. <strike>Figure out unit testing in C++</strike>
2. Static equalizer pattern
3. Bare minimum code implementation 
4. 3D model a basic pitch -> skirt, shirt -> animations
5. Requirement analysis - hardware, safety precautions

## Phase 2:
6. Distribute frequencies over LED vectors
7. Analyze FTT
8. Make equalizer pattern reactive

## Phase 3:
9. 2x2 pixel grid (integrate subpixels)
10. sound wave pattern
11. 3D print case
12. 3D print holder
13. Product assembly
