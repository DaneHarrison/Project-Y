# Phase breakdown
## Phase 1:
1. Figure out unit testing in C++
2. 3D model a basic pitch -> skirt, shirt -> animations
3. Requirement analysis - hardware, safety precautions
4. Static equalizer pattern

## Phase 2:
5. Distribute frequencies over LED vectors (1 or 2?)
6. Analyze FTT
7. Make equalizer pattern reactive

## Phase 3
8. 2x2 pixel grid (integrate subpixels)
9. sound wave pattern
10. 3D print case
11. 3D print holder
12. Product assembly
